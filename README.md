# ASTI-AUS-Internship
Given in this repository are the code made by F.Magallanes throughout his internship stay at ASTI under the AUS project.

I'm using two virtual environments in my working directory, kindly install them using the "coco_reqs.txt" and "cv_reqs.txt"; I use .coco virtualenv to do any pre-processing and data curation. I use the .cv virtualenv for my AI modelling and testing.
