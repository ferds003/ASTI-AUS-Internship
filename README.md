# ASTI-AUS-Internship
Given in this repository are the code made by F.Magallanes throughout his internship stay at ASTI under the AUS project.

I used two virtual environments in my working directory, kindly install them using the "coco_reqs.txt" (.coco) and "requirements.txt" (.cv); I use .coco virtualenv to do any pre-processing and data curation. I use the .cv virtualenv for my AI modelling and software prototyping.
